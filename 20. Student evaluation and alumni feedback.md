## How to view students' evaluation of college?
There are a few ways to view students' evaluations of colleges:

1. College review websites: Websites like Niche, College Confidential, and Unigo allow students to leave reviews of their college experiences. These reviews can provide valuable insights into the student experience at a particular college.

2. College websites: Many colleges have a section on their website where they showcase student testimonials and reviews. These can be helpful in understanding the student experience at a particular college.

3. Social media: Social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook can also provide insights into the student experience at a particular college. You can search for hashtags related to the college or look for posts from current or former students.

It's important to keep in mind that individual experiences can vary widely, so it's important to read multiple reviews and consider the source of the information before making any decisions based on student evaluations.
## How to understand the feedback from alumni to universities?
Alumni feedback can be a valuable tool for universities to understand how well they are preparing their students for life after graduation. Here are some tips for understanding alumni feedback:

1. Look for patterns: When reviewing alumni feedback, look for patterns in the comments. Are there common themes or issues that alumni are consistently mentioning? This can help identify areas where the university may need to improve.

2. Consider the source: It's important to consider the source of the feedback. Are the alumni recent graduates or have they been out of school for many years? Are they successful in their careers or struggling? This can help put the feedback into context.

3. Compare to other data: Alumni feedback should be considered in conjunction with other data, such as graduation rates, employment rates, and student satisfaction surveys. This can help provide a more complete picture of the university's performance.

4. Take action: Once the feedback has been analyzed, it's important for the university to take action. This could involve making changes to the curriculum, providing additional resources for students, or improving career services.

Overall, alumni feedback can be a valuable tool for universities to improve their programs and better prepare their students for success after graduation.
## Does student evaluation and alumni feedback affect the application?
Student evaluation and alumni feedback can have an impact on the college application process, but the extent of that impact can vary depending on the specific college or university. Some schools may consider student evaluations and alumni feedback as part of their admissions process, while others may not. 

In general, colleges and universities are interested in hearing from current students and alumni about their experiences with the school. This feedback can help the school understand what is working well and what areas may need improvement. 

If a college or university does consider student evaluations and alumni feedback as part of their admissions process, it may be used to help evaluate an applicant's fit with the school. For example, if a student's application indicates that they are interested in a particular program or extracurricular activity, the school may look to student evaluations and alumni feedback to see if that program or activity is well-regarded by current students and graduates. 

Overall, while student evaluations and alumni feedback may not be a primary factor in the admissions process, they can still play a role in helping colleges and universities evaluate applicants and make admissions decisions.
