It's important to research the social scene of a university before deciding to attend, as it can greatly impact your overall college experience. You can do this by talking to current students, visiting the campus, and researching online forums and social media groups.

## How to solve the safety of student social activities?
Ensuring the safety of student social activities is a critical concern for colleges and universities. Here are some steps that can be taken to address this issue:

1. Establish clear guidelines and policies: Colleges should have clear guidelines and policies in place that outline the expectations for student behavior during social activities. These policies should be communicated to students and enforced consistently.

2. Provide adequate supervision: Adequate supervision is essential to ensure the safety of student social activities. Colleges should ensure that there are enough staff members or volunteers present to monitor the event and intervene if necessary.

3. Conduct background checks: Colleges should conduct background checks on all staff members and volunteers who will be supervising student social activities. This can help identify any potential risks or red flags.

4. Provide training: Staff members and volunteers should receive training on how to handle potential safety issues, such as alcohol or drug use, sexual assault, or other forms of misconduct.

5. Encourage responsible behavior: Colleges should encourage responsible behavior among students by promoting safe and healthy social activities, providing education on the risks of alcohol and drug use, and encouraging students to look out for one another.

By taking these steps, colleges can help ensure the safety of student social activities and create a positive and healthy campus culture.
