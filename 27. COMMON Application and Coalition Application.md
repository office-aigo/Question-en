## What is the difference between the Common Application and Coalition Application?
The Common Application and Coalition Application are both online platforms that allow students to apply to multiple colleges and universities using a single application. However, there are some differences between the two.

The Common Application is accepted by over 900 colleges and universities in the United States and around the world. It allows students to fill out one application and send it to multiple schools. The Common App includes a personal essay, academic and extracurricular information, and a list of activities and achievements.

The Coalition Application is a newer platform that is accepted by over 150 colleges and universities. It also allows students to fill out one application and send it to multiple schools. The Coalition App includes a personal essay, academic and extracurricular information, and a list of activities and achievements. However, it also includes a section called the "locker," where students can store documents, videos, and other materials that showcase their achievements and interests.

Overall, both platforms are designed to simplify the college application process for students. The choice between the two will depend on which schools a student is applying to and which platform they feel most comfortable using.

## Do you accept the Common Application and Coalition Application every university?
No, not every university accepts both the Common Application and Coalition Application. While many universities accept both, some only accept one or the other, and some may have their own application system entirely. It's important to research each university's application requirements and deadlines to ensure that you are submitting the correct application.
