## How do international students evaluate their English level?
International students can evaluate their English level in a few different ways. One common method is to take an English proficiency test, such as TOEFL. These tests are designed to assess a student's ability to read, write, speak, and understand English. Another option is to take an English course or work with a tutor to improve their language skills and gain a better understanding of their proficiency level. Additionally, international students can practice their English by reading books, watching movies or TV shows in English, and engaging in conversations with native English speakers. It's important for international students to accurately assess their English level in order to determine which colleges and universities are the best fit for them and to prepare for the application process.
