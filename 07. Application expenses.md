## What costs do you need to pay for university applications?
The costs associated with university applications can vary depending on the number of schools you apply to and the type of application you submit. Here are some common costs to consider:

1. Application fees: Most universities require an application fee, which can range from $50 to $100 or more per application.

2. Test scores: If you are submitting standardized test scores (such as the SAT or ACT), there may be fees associated with sending those scores to universities. These fees can range from $12 to $16 per score report.

3. Transcript fees: Some high schools charge a fee for sending transcripts to universities. This fee can vary depending on the school.

4. Application platform fees: Some universities use application platforms like the Common Application or Coalition Application, which may charge a fee to use their services.

It's important to note that some universities offer fee waivers for students who demonstrate financial need. Additionally, some universities may waive application fees for students who attend college fairs or meet with admissions representatives. It's always a good idea to check with each university's admissions office to see if there are any fee waiver options available.
## Can the application fee be reduced?
In some cases, colleges may offer fee waivers or reductions for students who demonstrate financial need. Additionally, some colleges may offer fee waivers for students who attend college fairs or meet with admissions representatives at their high schools. It's always worth checking with the college's admissions office to see if they offer any fee reduction options.
