## Does graduation require a impact on students' employment?
Graduating from college can have a significant impact on a student's employment prospects. In general, individuals with a college degree tend to have higher earning potential and more job opportunities than those without a degree. Many employers require a college degree for certain positions, and having a degree can also demonstrate to employers that a candidate has the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in a particular field. Additionally, college graduates may have access to professional networks and job placement services through their alma mater, which can also be helpful in securing employment. However, it's important to note that a college degree is not a guarantee of employment, and other factors such as work experience, skills, and networking abilities can also play a role in a student's job prospects.
